GO: GETTING STARTED
----------------------------------------------------------------

Designed by google.

Fast compilation: unlike C++.
Fully compiled: more performant, take better advantage of resources.
Strongly typed: compiler checks types.
Concurrent by default.
Garbage collected.
Simplicity as a core value.

Some types of apps Go is better at: 
- web services (deliver data) and web applications (deliver web pages to some browser).
Multiple transactions happening simulatenously.
- Task automation as well. script, bash. works a bit like scripting languages.
- GUI / Thick-client. experimental library for this
- Machine Learning. Some similar characteristics with Python.
Web Services and Web Applications it's what it is best at.

DEMO: HELLO WORLD

play.golang.org an online editor to learn and explore

package main //every program begins with this

import () //import blocks import functionalities from other libraries

func main(){} //where the app starts

package main

// This is an import block, it allows multiple packages to be imported
// without repeating the "import" keyword
import (
    "fmt"
)
/* 
    The main function, when part of the main package, 
    identifies the entry point of an application.
*/
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, playground")
}

Error if you import a packcage and don't use it.
Use tabs. Format is important but won't fail the app if you don't follow it.
Enforces automatic semicolon. We don't add it, the compiler does.
Opening brace goes on the same line, once a line ends, compiler adds a semicolon.

--------------------------------------------------------------
STARTING A PROJECT
--------------------------------------------------------------

Set up a local development environment.

- Install and configure Go
- Go command
- Set up an editor
- Organize source code

1. Installing the Go Tools:

golang.org

Download Go: keep the default installation location C:\Go\
Type go version in a terminal, check that it's properly installed.

2. Overview of the Go command:

go enter: lists the commands.
go help <command> gives us info about that command
go doc <package> gives you the documentation of the package

3. Setting up an editor:

Visual Studio Code

Get a Go plugin: Go plugin supported by microsoft, get that one.
ctrol+shift+p: Go: Install/Update Tools -> select and install all packages
This is necessary to get the full plugin working.

Start with a simple application:

run the app: go run main.go

4. Creating a project

Create a place to house the source code.
Create a folder.
Initialize the module.
In terminal go to the folder then: go mod init <module name>
example: go mod init github.com/pluralsight/webservice
Now create  files: main.go
Create the hello world code.
Run it: use the go command with the mdoule name in the go.mod file
example: go run github.com/pluralsight/webservice

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKING WITH PRIMITIVE DATA types
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Declarations:

- var keyword, name, type
var i int 
i = 42

- Declare and Initialize
var f float32 = 3.14

- Just declare and Initialize: implies data type
firstName := "Arthur"
this is might be the most common

Unused variables generate a compiler error.

Other datatypes:
b := true (boolean)
c := complex(3, 4) (complex numbers! 3+4i)
r, im := real(c), imag(c) (multiple assignment and get the real and imaginary part of the complex number)


Pointers:

Variables are value types. They point to the value in memory.
Pointer: the address of a location in memory that holds the variable.

var keyword, name, *pointer data type
var firstName *string //pointer
if it prints nil the pointer isn't pointing to anything
firstName = "Arthur" doesn't work, you can't assign a string to a pointer type.

Dereferencing: I got a pointer, pointing to some data, go get the data and give it to me.
var firstName *string = new(string)
*firstName = "Arthur" //dereferencing operator
this firstName has the address
but *firstName has the actual value of what the pointer points to, because you are dereferencing

firstName := "Arthur"
ptr := &firstName //address of
ptr: address
*ptr: value Arthur
firstName = "Tricia"
ptr: same address as before
*ptr: value Tricia
The data stored changed but not where in the memory.


Constants:

Cannot change their value.

- const keyword name and value
const pi = 3.1415
Declare and initialize them.
A constant must get its value at compile time (can't initialize it with a function's return value, 'cause that happens in run time)
If you don't specify the type, compiler interprets the type.
const c int = 3 //now you are actually specifying the data type.
But you can "convert" the constant and force something to happen:
const c int = 3
c + 3 yes!
c + 1.2 no!
float32(c) + 1.2 yes!


Iota and Constant Expressions

Iotas

These must be on package level (outside a function). And you can access anywhere in the package.
There are import blocks and constant blocks.
const (
    first = 1
    second = "second"
)
Replace values with keyword iota:
const (
    first = iota
    second = iota
)
increments value by one. printing these two says 0 and 1
You can add something to it: iota + 6 and 2 << iota
0 + 6
1 << 2
this prints 6 and 4
you can also run:
const (
    first = iota +6
    second //this one reuses the above expression
)
this prints 6 for the first one and 7 for the second one

Constant Expressions: also evaluated on compile time.

const (
    first = iota
    second = iota
)
const (
    third = iota
)
I get 0, 1, 0
iota resets in different constant blocks

------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKING WITH COLLECTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------

Types: 
- Arrays: fixed size
- Slices: dynamically sized
- Maps: key value relationship instead of index
- Structs: there aren't classes in Go. A struct is the data part of a class.


Arrays:

A fix sized collection of a data type. All elements in it must be of the same type.

- var keyword, name, size and data type
var arr [3]int

- assign elements:
arr[0] = 1
arr[1] = 2
arr[2] = 3

- Implicit initialization
arr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}


Slices:

Like an array but more flexible. 
Use an array to build a slice.

arr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
slice := arr[:] //creates the slice from the beginning of arr to its ending. contains all its elements.

print arr: 1, 2, 3
print slice = 1, 2, 3

arr[1] = 42
slice[2] = 27
print arr: 1, 42, 27
print slice: 1, 42, 27

Any changes to the array, are reflected on the slice. same with the slice and array.

- Create a slice not on top of a explicit array:
slice := []int{1, 2, 3}
no size specified. compiler knows it's a slice and creates the array with 1, 2 and 3 on it's own while slice points to it.
Add stuff to the slice:
slice = append(slice, 4) //variable to which I'll append, value to append
print slice: 1, 2, 3, 4
And what happened to the array it was based on? It doesn't matter, Go does it for us. But what it does is create a new array with the new data and size.
It's automatic and Go takes care of it.

- Another use of : to create a slice of an array.
Create slice of a slice:
s2 := slice[1:] starts at index 1 to the end
s3 := slice[:2] starts at the beginning, index 0, up to and not including index 2
s4 := slice[1:2] starts at index 1 and goes up to but not including index 2

slice: 1, 2, 3, 4, 42, 27
print them:
s2 = 2, 3, 4, 42, 27
s3: 1, 2
s4: 2

Maps:

Associate keys and values.

- map keyword, type of the key, values to store
m := map[string]int{"foo":42} curly braces to initialize
- an element of the map: m["foo"] prints the value 42
- assign value: m["foo"] = 27 now prints 27
- delete: delete(m, "foo") map to delete from and key to delete

Structs:

A collection of different data types. Fields are fixed at compile time.
Define it, initiliaze it.

- type keyword, name, struct keyword
type user struct {
    ID int
    FirstName string
    LastName string
}
var u user
u.ID = 1
u.FirstName = "Arthur"
u.LastName = "Dent"

- short initialization:
u2 := user{ ID: 1, 
    FirstName: "Arthur", 
    LastName: "Dent", //adding that comma for the compiler else you'll get an error
    }


PROJECT:

Create packages. Units of code associated to some concept.
Create a package: create a folder, models.
Create a source file in it.
package main is the entry point for the application.
Another package won't be called like that, it's support for the app.

Build command: go build github.com/pluralsight/webservice
creates an executable.
Run it just like webservice.executable
